Usage
=====
This chapter of the documentation will teach you how to set your own MUD server up.

-------
Basics
-------
To run your server, you are going to need at least two folders. You need a map folder and a player data folder.
Those folders are going to contain a lot of JSON files, some generated by the server and some created by yourself. If you delete any of the files in those directories, you server becomes vulnarable to crashes, as required data will cease to exist. If you want to delete an area from you server, you need to also remove the area from all players files (JSON files located in the player data directory).

Once you have created those two folders, you can start configuring the MUD and server themselves.
Here is an example of the most working server possible:

.. code:: python

    # Import the library
    import mudblood
    # Initiate the server
    server = mudblood.main.Server()
    # Start the main server loop
    while True:
        server.update()


--------
The map
--------
The map consists of many different JSON files, one file for each area.
The area consists of room, which all have players, objects and other things in them. Here is an example for a very basic area:

.. code:: JSON

    {
    "rooms": {
        "main": {
            "look": "You can see a circular plaza. You can see people arrive here seemingly out of nowhere.",
            "players": [
                0
            ],
            "objects": {
                "tree": {
                    "search": "A very fine oak tree."
                }
            },
            "characters": {
                "Draagon": {
                    "type": "dialogue",
                    "dialogue": [
                        "Hey! My name is Draagon!",
                        "Feel free to talk to me at any time!"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "obvious-exits": {
                "east": {
                    "area": "lobby",
                    "room": "forrest",
                    "position": [
                        1,
                        0
                    ]
                },
                "north": {
                    "area": "lobby",
                    "room": "trees",
                    "position": [
                        0,
                        -1
                    ]
                }
            },
            "position": [
                0,
                0
            ]
        },
        "forrest": {
            "look": "This is the text shown when the player runs \"look\"",
            "players": [],
            "objects": {},
            "characters": {},
            "obvious-exits": {
                "west": {
                    "area": "lobby",
                    "room": "main",
                    "position": [
                        0,
                        0
                    ]
                }
            },
            "position": [
                1,
                0
            ]
        }
    }


--------
Settings
--------
There are a lot of settings for you to configure to your liking. You can change those settings either when initiating the server, or on runtime.

Here is an example on how to set a setting while initiating:

.. code:: python

    server = mudblood.main.Server(tick_time=1)

However, if you want to change a setting while the server is already running, or want more readable code, you can change settings on runtime:

.. code:: python

    server = mudblood.main.Server()
    server.tick_time = 1
